    TODO: Support t-batches of initial conditions.

    Args:
        acq_function: The acquisition function to be optimized.
        bounds: A `2 x d` tensor of lower and upper bounds for each column of `X`.
        q: The number of candidates to consider.
        num_restarts: The number of starting points for multistart acquisition
            function optimization.
        raw_samples: The number of raw samples to consider in the initialization
            heuristic. Note: if `sample_around_best` is True (the default is False),
            then `2 * raw_samples` samples are used.
        fixed_features: A map `{feature_index: value}` for features that
            should be fixed to a particular value during generation.
        options: Options for initial condition generation. For valid options see
            `initialize_q_batch` and `initialize_q_batch_nonneg`. If `options`
            contains a `nonnegative=True` entry, then `acq_function` is
            assumed to be non-negative (useful when using custom acquisition
            functions). In addition, an "init_batch_limit" option can be passed
            to specify the batch limit for the initialization. This is useful
            for avoiding memory limits when computing the batch posterior over
            raw samples.
        inequality constraints: A list of tuples (indices, coefficients, rhs),
            with each tuple encoding an inequality constraint of the form
            `\sum_i (X[indices[i]] * coefficients[i]) >= rhs`.
        equality constraints: A list of tuples (indices, coefficients, rhs),
            with each tuple encoding an inequality constraint of the form
            `\sum_i (X[indices[i]] * coefficients[i]) = rhs`.

    Returns:

    r"""Heuristic for selecting initial conditions for candidate generation.

    This heuristic selects points from `X` (without replacement) with probability
    proportional to `exp(eta * Z)`, where `Z = (Y - mean(Y)) / std(Y)` and `eta`
    is a temperature parameter.

    When using an acquisiton function that is non-negative and possibly zero
    over large areas of the feature space (e.g. qEI), you should use
    `initialize_q_batch_nonneg` instead.

    Args:
        X: A `b x batch_shape x q x d` tensor of `b` - `batch_shape` samples of
            `q`-batches from a d`-dim feature space. Typically, these are generated
            using qMC sampling.
        Y: A tensor of `b x batch_shape` outcomes associated with the samples.
            Typically, this is the value of the batch acquisition function to be
            maximized.
        n: The number of initial condition to be generated. Must be less than `b`.
        eta: Temperature parameter for weighting samples.

    Returns:

        conditions, where each batch of `n x q x d` samples is selected independently.

    Example:
        >>> # To get `n=10` starting points of q-batch size `q=3`
