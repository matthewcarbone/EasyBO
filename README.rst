Installation
------------

Users
^^^^^
To simply use the software, install it as you would any Python package: `pip install EasyBO`. **COMING SOON!**

Developers
^^^^^^^^^^
If you wish to help us improve EasyBO, you should fork a copy of our repository, clone to disk, and then proceed with setting up the following:

- Create a fresh virtual environment, e.g. ``conda create -n py3.9 python=3.9``.
- Install the development requirements, ``pip install -r requirements-dev.txt``
- Setup the pre-commit hooks ``pre-commit install``
- If you want to install the package to your default paths, you can do this in "developer mode" by running ``pip install -e ".[dev]"``
